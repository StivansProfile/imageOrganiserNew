# Image Organiser

<h1>What is it ?</h1>
<p>A tool that nicely organises your images and allows you to upload them to the cloud.</p>
<p>Since we all have a ton of images on our phones, we sometimes tent to forget about how messy our galleries look.</p>
<p>This then leads to us having to spend a ton of time trying to find images that we may need.</p>
<p>For that reason I decided to built a simple image organiser tool that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Saves you phone space</li>
  <li>2. Allows you to organise images nicely</li>
  <li>3. Has intuitive design and very easy to use user interface</li>
</ul>

<h1>How was it built ?</h1>
<p>This is a serverless app, meaning all of the images and other data is stored securely on a third-party server provider</p>
<p>In this case Google/Firebase.</p>
<p>The tech stack</p>

<ul>
  <li>React + TypeScript</li>
</ul>
